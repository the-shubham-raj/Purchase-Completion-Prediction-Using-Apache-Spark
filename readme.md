# E-commerce Purchase Completion Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict customer purchase completion on e-commerce platforms. By analyzing session-level data, we aim to identify key behavioral patterns and optimize conversion rates.

## Introduction

Understanding customer behavior is crucial for enhancing e-commerce platforms. Predicting whether a customer will complete a purchase is a critical task. Traditional analytics methods often fall short, making machine learning (ML) a valuable, data-driven solution. This project explores various ML algorithms to predict purchase completion using session-level data, aiming to improve conversion rates and lay the groundwork for intelligent recommendation and retargeting systems.

## Objectives

- **Evaluate ML Models:** Assess the performance of supervised ML algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting in predicting purchase completion.
- **Feature Analysis:** Identify key behavioral and session-level features that influence purchase decisions, such as time spent on the site, pages viewed, device type, and traffic source.
- **Model Optimization:** Improve predictive performance through feature engineering, handling class imbalance, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Practical Implementation:** Propose strategies for integrating predictive models into real-time systems and personalized marketing efforts to improve conversion rates.

## Project Description

This project applies machine learning to predict customer purchase completion based on session behavior.

### Data Utilization

Features include session time, pages visited, referral source, and cart abandonment rate. The target variable is binary, indicating whether a purchase was completed or not.

### Algorithm Selection

- **Decision Trees:** Chosen for their interpretability and ability to handle both categorical and numerical features.
- **Indexing & Vectorization:** Used for transforming categorical data into numerical representations.

### Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of the model.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Provides insight into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

### Implementation

- **Apache Spark (PySpark):** For scalable data processing and ML pipeline creation.
- **Databricks:** Unified platform for executing the project in a collaborative cloud environment.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For generating visualizations (pie charts, bar graphs, scatter plots).
- **Pandas:** Used for data conversion and manipulation for visualization.

## Scope

### Short-Term Scope

- Build and evaluate ML models that predict purchase completion with high accuracy.
- Identify key behavioral indicators (session time, referral source, cart abandonment rate).
- Visualize user behavior patterns using graphs and plots.

### Long-Term Scope

- Expand the dataset with additional behavioral metrics (mouse movement, time on page, product interactions).
- Integrate real-time prediction models for personalized offers and reminders.
- Employ advanced models (ensemble techniques, neural networks) to improve accuracy.
- Explore user segmentation and personalization strategies to optimize the sales funnel.
